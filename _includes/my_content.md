Hi, I'm Florian. I work as a postdoctoral research associate in the lab of Sohrab Shah in the Department of Computational Oncology at Memorial Slaon Kettering Cancer Center, New York. My research projects revolve around understanding the immune microenvironment of ovarian and lung cancer patients using a range of single-cell omics methods.
