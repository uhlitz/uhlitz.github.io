I'm a	second year PhD student at [BSIO](http://bsio-cancerschool.de) (Berlin School of Integrative Oncology) in the group of Prof. Nils Blüthgen, [Computational Modelling in Medicine](http://sys-bio.net/). We're associated with the [Institute for Theoretical Biology](https://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/wiki/) at Humboldt-University of Berlin, the [Laboratory of Molecular Tumour Pathology](http://mtp.charite.de/) at Charité and the [IRI Life Sciences](http://www.iri-lifesciences.de/en/home.html).

## Research Interest

I am interested in how MAP kinase signalling modulates RNA dynamics. My goal is to quantitatively determine how _cis_ and _trans_ elements relay signalling input dynamics to transcript output dynamics.
