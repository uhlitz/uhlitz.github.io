# CV landing page

This is my github.io homepage serving as a static resume. I used [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [compass](https://github.com/excentris/compass), [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [AcademIcons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) to create this page.
