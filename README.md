# CV landing page

This is my github.io homepage serving as a static resume. I used [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [compass](https://github.com/excentris/compass), [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [AcademIcons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) to create this page.

# Notes to myself

## How to maintain

1. edit `_includes/my_content.md` and check updated site locally with 

```
jekyll serve
```

2. commit changes and push to github

## Modifications

Added [itemprops](https://schema.org/Person) for SEO.
